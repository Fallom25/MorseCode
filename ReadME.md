## Morse Code Encoder and Decoder - Project for _Nology

## Project Description
The aim of this project was to build a basic Morse-Code Encoder and Decoder App

## How to Install and Run
I use the VSCode extension LiveServer to run my HTML websites locally.

## How to use
### Instructions 
- Enter you English in the Encoder or Morse Code in the Decode and hit the button.
- In this morse code three spaces "___" means it is a new letter, an "/" means it is a new word.
- Valid Characters are (0-9), (a-z), (! . , )

### Encoder: 
- add some text to the green Encoder box
- click the Encode button 
- Morse Code will appear in the Box

### Decoder:
- add some Morse-code to the red box
- click the Decode button
- Plain English will appear in the box

## Outline of my Solution


## Considerations and Further Growth
Would like to add the ability for users to enter their own delim.

### Testing
Tests are written but are not working properly with current set up.
Window Alert is not currently being tested this is something I would like to add in the future.
